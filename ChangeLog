    * Added SDL_image as a dependency
    * Added a second help menu (F2)
    * Added blendmode command which has 5 blending modes (L key)
    * Added demo.cfg to distribution (woops)
    * Added sprite particle effects!
          o It is on by default and uses the GL_ARB_point_parameters and GL_ARB_point_sprite extensions.
          o Unfortunately these extensions may not work under certain conditions. Turning particlerendermode to 0 will make particles visible again.
          o It will fall back to the original GL_POINT renderer if your card does not support them. It will also tell you that it has done this.
          o Added particle.png
                + To modify it, save it as a transparent 24bit png.
                + If you modify it and it looks cool send it my way! 
    * Added particlerendermode command (0=original 1=sprites) ( \ Key )
    * Added particlesizemin ( Keys: - = ) and particlesizemax ( Keys: [ ] ) commands to change the size of your particles.
          o When you're in particlerendermode 0 only particlesizemin applies

          o There are three modes: 0 off, 1 lines, 2 boxes
