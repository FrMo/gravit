Gravit ChangeLog

0.2.1 2005/04/08

    * Added recordingvideorefreshtime command to allow Gravit to render to the screen while recording a frame or spawning particles.
          o This makes your FPS smoother during a recording.
          o Also allows you to restart the spawn process while spawning lots of particles.
          o With a lot of particles, you can see the octtree being generated!!
          o See gravit.cfg for more details... 
    * Added colourschemenew and colourschemeadd commands to allow you to customise the colour scheme
    * Recording is now about twice as fast due to an inefficient distance calculation. (Thanks to Michael Vanslembrouck for pointing that out)
    * Window Title now tells the status of your recording. For example "17/2532 (skip:16)" means 17 frames recorded our of a 2532 maximum with a record skip of 16.
    * spawning galaxy sizes fixed
    * grativ.cfg sets videobpp to 32 now, instead of 16.
    * Windows zip's have renamed files to ChangeLog.txt and README.txt 

0.2 2005/04/07

    * Added SDL_image as a dependency
    * Added a second help menu (F2)
    * Added blendmode command which has 5 blending modes (L key)
    * Added demo.cfg to distribution (woops)
    * Added sprite particle effects!
          o It is on by default and uses the GL_ARB_point_parameters and GL_ARB_point_sprite extensions.
          o Unfortunately these extensions may not work under certain conditions. Turning particlerendermode to 0 will make particles visible again.
          o It will fall back to the original GL_POINT renderer if your card does not support them. It will also tell you that it has done this.
          o Added particle.png
                + To modify it, save it as a transparent 24bit png.
                + If you modify it and it looks cool send it my way! 
    * Added particlerendermode command (0=original 1=sprites) ( \ Key )
    * Added particlesizemin ( Keys: - = ) and particlesizemax ( Keys: [ ] ) commands to change the size of your particles.
          o When you're in particlerendermode 0 only particlesizemin applies 
    * Added drawtree command which displays the last generated Oct Tree (T key)
          o There are three modes: 0 off, 1 lines, 2 boxes
          o leaf nodes are highlighted 
    * Added screenshot and screenshotloop commands, they are also bound to F9 and F10. They create (many) BMP files.
          o This will make a screenshots directory for you.
          o Careful! F10 takes a screenshot every frame! 
    * Added a new colour mode: Acceleration!
    * Colour modes can be changed with the / key.
    * Console can now be escaped by pressing escape, backtick (`) and hitting enter on an empty command
    * Console cursor blinking is now based on time instead of frames
    * Console input box is a little more obvious when active
    * Added drawosd command which can hide the text ( O key )
    * If initializing video fails, it will try change some settings for you and try again.
    * All text files are saved in UNIX file format
    * README, ChangeLog and config files are now in Windows format in the Windows packages
    * Fixed permissions in tarball to 644
    * Fixed library include path (/usr/X11R6/lib) issue (Alec)
    * tailskip variable caused an infinitle loop when set to 0 (fixed)
    * Many Makefile changes
    * Added an icon!
    * Thanks to Alec Thomas for Linux testing and code fixes!
