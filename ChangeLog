0.2-devel 2005/04/05

    * Added SDL_image as a dependency
    * Added glew as a dependency
    * Added a second help menu (F2)
    * Added particle effects!
          o It is on by default and uses the GL_ARB_point_parameters and GL_ARB_point_sprite extensions.
          o It will fall back to the original GL_POINT renderer if your card does not support them. It will also tell you that it has done this.
          o Added particle.png
                + To modify it, save it as a transparent 24bit png.
                + If you modify it and it looks cool send it my way! 
    * Added particlerendermode command (0=norm 1=billboarding)
    * Added particlesizemin ( Keys: - = ) and particlesizemax ( Keys: [ ] )commands to change the size of your particles.
          o When you're in particlerendermode 0 only particlesizemin applies
          o You can automatically use the maximum size possible by your card in particlerendermode 1 by setting particlesizemax to -1 (this is default)
          o particlesizemin is cool! Make it big and zoom in! 
    * Fixed Displaying Oct Tree toggle (T key)
          o Will highlight leafs nodes in bright blue 
    * Added screenshot and screenshotloop commands, they are also bound to F9 and F10. They create (many) BMP files.
          o This will make a screenshots directory for you, but I haven't tried the Linux version. 
    * Added a new colour mode: Acceleration!
    * Colour modes can be changed with the / key.
    * Console can now be escaped by pressing escape, backtick (`) and hitting enter on an empty command
    * Console cursor blinking is now based on time instead of frames
    * Console input box is a little more obvious when active
    * tailskip variable caused an infinitle loop when set to 0 (fixed)
