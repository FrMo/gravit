Overview

    Gravit is current in a development stage. There may be bugs that I'm not aware of. I would appreciate your feedback and any problems you've had to face!

Configuration

    Once you have installed Gravit (see below) you should configure it to make it work as well as possible on your system. To do this, open up gravit.cfg in your favorite text editor and follow the instructions. By default the configuration is set to use 256MB of RAM, and only run in windowed mode at 800x600x16.

Prerequisites

    You need the following libraries before attempting to compile or run Gravit.

    * SDL (at least version 1.2.6)
          o http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php 
    * SDL_ttf
          o http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/ 
    * SDL_image
          o http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/ 
    * GLEW
          o http://glew.sourceforge.net/ 

Installation for Windows

   1. Extract the ZIP file as you already have into a directory.
   2. You may need to download copy SDL.dll, SDL_ttf.dll, SDL_image.dll and glew.dll into the same directory as gravit.exe
          * SDL.dll is at http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.8-win32.zip
          * SDL_ttf.dll is at http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/release/SDL_ttf-2.0.7-win32.zip
          * SDL_image.dll is at http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/release/SDL_image-1.2.4-win32.zip
          * glew.dll is at http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/glew/glew-1.3.2-win32.zip?download 
   3. Open up gravit.cfg and change it to your liking.
   4. Run gravit.exe from that directory! 

Installation for Linux

   1. Extract the tarball somewhere as you already have:
          * tar xzvf gravit-src-0.2.tgz 
   2. You will need:
          * SDL, SDL_ttf and SDL_image installed and working. (Try sdl-config --version)
          * GLEW
          * OpenGL (accelerated preferably) 
   3. Run make
   4. Open up gravit.cfg and change it to your liking.
   5. Hopefully that should have compiled a gravit binary!
