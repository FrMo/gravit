Graviton Version 0.1

Overview
This is an early test release. I would really like your feedback especially if
you had to change the code to get it to work.

Here are a few settings that can only be changed:
through modifying the code:
- Video resolution is set to fullscreen 1280x1024 with 32bpp
- Memory use is set to 128MB

Installation for Windows

1) Extract the ZIP file as you already have into a directory.

2) You will need to download copy SDL.DLL and SDL_ttf.DLL into the same directory as graviton.exe
  - SDL.DLL is at http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.8-win32.zip
  - SDL_ttf.DLL is at http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/release/SDL_ttf-2.0.7-win32.zip

3) Run graviton.exe from that directory
 
Installation for Linux

1) Extract the tarball somewhere as you already have:
  - tar xzvf graviton-src-0.1.tgz

2) You will need:
  - SDL and SDL_ttf installed and sdl-config working. (Try sdl-config --version)
  - OpenGL (accelerated preferably)

3) Run make

4) Hopefully that should have compiled a graviton binary!
