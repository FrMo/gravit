Gravit Version 0.3.2

Overview

    Gravit is currently in a development stage. There may be bugs that I'm not aware of. I would appreciate your feedback and any problems you've had to face!

Configuration

    Once you have installed Gravit (see below) you should configure it to make it work as well as possible on your system. To do this, open up gravit.cfg in your favorite text editor and follow the instructions. By default the configuration is set to use 256MB of RAM, and only run in windowed mode at 800x600x32.

Documentation

    The documentation is a work in progress at:

    * http://gravit.slowchop.com/docs/ 

Troubleshooting

    * If you have any problems check the gravit.cfg file, it has lots of information about possible problems.
    * Otherwise send me an e-mail describing the problem along with video card, cpu, o/s, etc.. 

Prerequisites

    You need the following libraries before attempting to compile or run Gravit.

    * SDL (at least version 1.2.6)
          o http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php 
    * SDL_ttf
          o http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/ 
    * SDL_image
          o http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/ 

Installation for Windows (Windows Installer)

   1. Execute the installer (as you already have)
   2. At the end of the installer:
          * Ask you to modify gravit.cfg. Do it, and read through it... especially if you have problems or want the coolest effects!
          * The installer will prompt you to install the screensaver. This will popup the screensaver dialog when it installs it.
          * Ask you to run Gravit. This will run Gravit with default settings. 
   3. Once Gravit is installed, you will have some handy short cuts in your Program Group in your Start Menu. 

Installation for Windows (Windows Zip)

   1. Extract the ZIP file as you already have into a directory.
   2. You may need to download copy SDL.dll, SDL_ttf.dll and SDL_image.dll (and corresponding dll's) into your c:\windows\system32 (or wherever it is on your computer)
          * SDL.dll is at http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.8-win32.zip
          * SDL_ttf.dll is at http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/release/SDL_ttf-2.0.7-win32.zip
          * SDL_image.dll is at http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/release/SDL_image-1.2.4-win32.zip 
   3. Open up gravit.cfg and change it to your liking.
   4. Run gravit.exe from that directory! 

Installation for Linux

   1. Extract the tarball somewhere as you already have:
          * tar xzvf gravit-src-0.2.tgz 
   2. You will need:
          * SDL, SDL_ttf and SDL_image installed and working. (Try sdl-config --version)
          * OpenGL (accelerated preferably) 
   3. Run make
   4. Open up gravit.cfg and change it to your liking.
   5. Hopefully that should have compiled a gravit binary!
