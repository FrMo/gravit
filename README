Overview
This is an early test release. I would really like your feedback especially if
you had to change the code to get it to work.

Configuring


Installation for Windows

1) Extract the ZIP file as you already have into a directory.

2) You may need to download copy SDL.DLL and SDL_ttf.DLL into the same directory as graviton.exe
  - SDL.DLL is at http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.8-win32.zip
  - SDL_ttf.DLL is at http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/release/SDL_ttf-2.0.7-win32.zip

3) Run graviton.exe from that directory!
 
Installation for Linux

1) Extract the tarball somewhere as you already have:
  - tar xzvf graviton-src-0.1.tgz

2) You will need:
  - SDL and SDL_ttf installed and sdl-config working. (Try sdl-config --version)
  - OpenGL (accelerated preferably)

3) Run make

4) Hopefully that should have compiled a graviton binary!
